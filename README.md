# UFOs
## Overview
A page was created to display a chart of UFO sightings. The chart can be filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results
To filter the chart, you can type as many criteria as you would like. There is no need to press a button, the chart will update automatically with each new search criteria.

In the example above, we filtered by date "1/2/2010" and shape "sphere". We got 2 results. 

## Summary
The table and filters are useful to narrow down the information. It looks like the comments could be cleaned up. Also, would be nice to add a filter for the duration of the event.
